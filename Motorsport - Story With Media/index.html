            <h2>
              Difficult challenges has always welcomed well engineered solutions
            </h2>
            <p>
              In the world of racing, the goal has always been to be the
              fastest. But this does not come without danger to both the driver
              and the car, so motivated engineers have always been looking for
              the best solutions to these problems. The faster the car can go,
              the faster it has to be able to stop. And the faster the wheels
              spin, the more stable they have to be. <br /><br />
              This, combined with many other challenges, such as weight,
              aerodynamics, and fuel consumption, has motivated the development
              of new technology in cars.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aerodynamics is a key factor in racing cars, as drag can slow down
              a car significantly. This has led to the development of many
              aerodynamic solutions, such as the rear wing, diffusers, and
              splitters, which are now common in many high-performance cars.
              This is also the case with weight, as lighter cars are faster and
              more agile. This has led to the development of new materials, such
              as carbon fiber, which is now used in many high-performance cars.
              These are just some of the technologies that have been developed
              for racing cars, but are now implemented in many high end cars and
              electric vechicles.

            <h2>But what parts have motorsport influenced?</h2>
            <p>
              A lot of car parts have been around for a long time, such as the
              wheel, this was nothing new when they started to make racing cars.
              But the wheel has been improved significantly over the years.
              Everything from new materials, and new track designs for different
              purposes, even different sizes. The wheel is one of the most basic
              parts of a car, but it is also one of the most important. Because
              without it, the car will not move, at least not in a very good
              way.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is many parts that wasn`t created for racing cars, but
              engineers have improved them significantly for that purpose.
              Ergonomic steering wheels for example, made to give the driver a
              better grip in high speed corners, and to make it easier to
              control the car. This is now a common feature in many cars, and
              has been for many years.

            <h2>Semi-automatic gears</h2>
            <p>
              Race cars have used conventional gearboxes since they began, but
              after Porsche introduced the direct shift gearbox in 1984 for the
              Porsche 962, which allowed shifting without a clutch, this
              technology has evolved into paddle shifters on the steering wheel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although paddle shifters are not as widespread and common as once
              expected, they are still widely available in many cars and are
              often an optional feature that can be ordered in many new
              petrol-powered cars.
            </p>
            <p>
              The technology has also been implemented in electric cars, where
              the paddle shifters are used to adjust the regenerative braking
              force, which can be used to slow down the car without using the
              brake pedal.

            <h2>Disc Brakes</h2>
            <p>
              Originally, brake discs were introduced by Porsche in the 24 Hours
              of Le Mans race, and since then, they have been implemented in
              almost all everyday cars since the 1980s.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since it is now possible to brake without locking the steering
              wheel, this has impacted both the safety and efficiency of the
              brakes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, there has been a shift away from standard steel brakes,
              which are most common in regular cars, toward ceramic brakes in
              cars that require lighter materials and better heat resistance, a
              feature often needed in race cars and the fastest road cars.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ceramic brakes are also more durable and have a longer lifespan
              than steel brakes, but they are also more expensive to produce and
              replace.

            <h2>Rear View Mirrors</h2>
            <p>
              The rearview mirror was first used in the 1911 Indianapolis 500 by
              Ray Harrou and has since become a standard feature in all
              vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though we may take the rearview mirror for granted, it wasn’t
              always present. Since its introduction, the rearview mirror has
              become a must-have feature, providing much better safety and
              visibility in almost every situation on the road. The rearview
              mirror is also required by law in most countries today.

            <h2>Is the influence relevant?</h2>
            <p>
              Motorsport innovations, such as the direct shift gearbox, paddle
              shifters, brake discs, and ceramic brakes, have significantly
              influenced everyday car technology, enhancing both performance and
              safety.
            </p>
            <p>
              Features like the rearview mirror, now standard in all vehicles,
              continue to improve driver awareness and road safety. Though some
              technologies have not become as widespread as initially expected,
              many have become essential or high-performance options in modern
              vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
              The influence of motorsport on everyday cars is still relevant
              today, as engineers continue to develop new technologies to
              improve performance, safety, and efficiency in both racing and
              everyday cars. Lighter materials have led to more fuel-efficient
              cars, something that also benefits the environment, and the time
              it takes to bring the vechicles to a complete stop.
